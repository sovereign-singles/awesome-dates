Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the thing you're submitting and why it should be included.**
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If you're submitting a closed source app, include evidence of it being built with Electron.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

### Updating your PR

If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
